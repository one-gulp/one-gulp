<h1 id="an-exhibit-of-markdown">An exhibit of Markdown</h1>
<p>This note demonstrates some of what <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> is capable of doing.</p>
<p><em>Note: Feel free to play with this page. Unlike regular notes, this doesn&#39;t automatically save itself.</em></p>
<h2 id="basic-formatting">Basic formatting</h2>
<p>Paragraphs can be written like so. A paragraph is the basic block of Markdown. A paragraph is what text will turn into when there is no reason it should become anything else.</p>
<p>Paragraphs must be separated by a blank line. Basic formatting of <em>italics</em> and <strong>bold</strong> is supported. This <em>can be <strong>nested</strong> like</em> so.</p>
<h2 id="lists">Lists</h2>
<h3 id="ordered-list">Ordered list</h3>
<ol>
<li>Item 1</li>
<li>A second item</li>
<li>Number 3</li>
<li>Ⅳ</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: the fourth item uses the Unicode character for <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2163/index.htm">Roman numeral four</a>.</em></p>
<h3 id="unordered-list">Unordered list</h3>
<ul>
<li>An item</li>
<li>Another item</li>
<li>Yet another item</li>
<li>And there&#39;s more...</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paragraph-modifiers">Paragraph modifiers</h2>
<h3 id="code-block">Code block</h3>
<pre><code>Code blocks are very useful for developers and other people who look at code or other things that are written in plain text. As you can see, it uses a fixed-width font.
</code></pre><p>You can also make <code>inline code</code> to add code into other things.</p>
<h3 id="quote">Quote</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Here is a quote. What this is should be self explanatory. Quotes are automatically indented when they are used.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="headings">Headings</h2>
<p>There are six levels of headings. They correspond with the six levels of HTML headings. You&#39;ve probably noticed them already in the page. Each level down uses one more hash character.</p>
<h3 id="headings-can-also-contain-formatting-">Headings <em>can</em> also contain <strong>formatting</strong></h3>
<h3 id="they-can-even-contain-inline-code-">They can even contain <code>inline code</code></h3>
<p>Of course, demonstrating what headings look like messes up the structure of the page.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t recommend using more than three or four levels of headings here, because, when you&#39;re smallest heading isn&#39;t too small, and you&#39;re largest heading isn&#39;t too big, and you want each size up to look noticeably larger and more important, there there are only so many sizes that you can use.</p>
<h2 id="urls">URLs</h2>
<p>URLs can be made in a handful of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>A named link to <a href="http://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a>. The easiest way to do these is to select what you want to make a link and hit <code>Ctrl+L</code>.</li>
<li>Another named link to <a href="http://www.markitdown.net/">MarkItDown</a></li>
<li>Sometimes you just want a URL like <a href="http://www.markitdown.net/">http://www.markitdown.net/</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="horizontal-rule">Horizontal rule</h2>
<p>A horizontal rule is a line that goes across the middle of the page.</p>
<hr>
<p>It&#39;s sometimes handy for breaking things up.</p>
<h2 id="images">Images</h2>
<p>Markdown can also contain images. I&#39;ll need to add something here sometime.</p>
<h2 id="finally">Finally</h2>
<p>There&#39;s actually a lot more to Markdown than this. See the official <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics">introduction</a> and <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax">syntax</a> for more information. However, be aware that this is not using the official implementation, and this might work subtly differently in some of the little things.</p>
